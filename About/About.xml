	<description>Adds in the Orsimer race, a somewhat brutish elven race. The Orsimer are well known for their strength, they are better at throwing a punch, and taking one, and have a higher mining speed than most other races. They also have increased resistance to psychic effects. However, their appearance causes them to have a lower social impact, and they learn new skills slightly slower. Orsimer are also known to enter a beserker rage when they take enough damage in combat, increasing their movement and manipulation, and decreasing pain, but clouding their senses, decreasing their sight and hearing. They enter a drained state once the rage wears off, preventing them from entering another rage for 11 hours.\n\nAdditionaly, this mod includes several pieces of armour, several weapons, the echatere and the welwa.\n\n-Supports Vanilla Achievements Expanded\n-Requires Humanoid Alien Races 2.0\n-Includes a patch for Vanilla Framework Expanded, adding support for shields to several weapons.\n-Includes several patches to add welwa and echatere to modded biomes.\n-Based on the 'Elder Scrolls' series by Bethesda Game Studios.
