		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was rather skilled at crafting traditional Orsimer armour. Not the primitive stuff the less experienced Orsimer make, but instead finely crafted armour fit for a warrior of stature. Needless to say [PAWN_possessive] crafts were more popular with Imperials than with Orsimer.</baseDesc>

		<title>simple Orcish smith</title>
		<titleShort>smith</titleShort>
		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] made armour for [PAWN_possessive] stronghold. Not the needlessly fancy stuff, but the simple stuff that protects you, and does a good job at it. There was also the bonus that this armour was easy to make, which meant [PAWN_nameDef] often had quite a bit of spare time. [PAWN_pronoun] usually spent this time roasting meat in the forge.</baseDesc>
